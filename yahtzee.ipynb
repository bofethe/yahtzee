    "## History\n",
    "Yahtzee is a dice game that originates from a Canadian couple who creatively called it \"The Yacht Game\" because they would play it on their yacht with friends. In 1956, Polish toymaker and entrepreneur, Edwin S. Lowe, introduced this game into the market and it was later purchased by Milton Bradley in 1973. This game combines strategy, probability, and luck to achieve the highest score."

    "\n",
    "The round starts with the player rolling 5 dice. The player then decides which dice they wish to keep or re-roll for up to 3 rolls. Once the turn is over, a score is recorded on the scorecard for one of the categories based on the available points in the last roll. The scorecard is broken up into an upper and lower section.  The upper section consists of basic points focued on counting only multiples of a specefic number on the dice. If the upper section of the score card exceeds 63, then an additional 35 points is awarded. The lower section consists of more creative combinations where you need to get 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, a full house (3 of a kind + 2 of a kind), a small straight (4 consecutive numbers), a large straight (5 consecutive numbers), yahtzee (5 of the same number), and chance(sumation of all dice). The player can only score once per round and all scores are final. The game ends once all 13 categories are filled in."
